Freeze all the weight in the VGG19
Original image style image generated image(noise)
input generated image to become original image with the style of style image
Remove fc layers
Get output from conv layers after pooling layers
Loss = alha * content_loss(C,G) + beta * style_loss(S,G)
C - content image\
G - generated image
S - style image
Content loss = MSE(original -generated) take the norm of every layer  = activations
Style loss = gram matrices for the generated and style image
multiply output form conv layer with its transpose
style_loss = sum(Gram_generated - gram_style)^2
